Note: THIS CAN TAKE A LONG TIME TO RUN.  Sorry, it requires loading a large 
dataset into memory and parsing it twice (there's probably ways to speed this 
up but those will take too long to implement)

# Instructions to use:

Edit the .py file and replace the conflict ID in the parse_conflict_num() 
function with whatever conflict ID you want (by default it's set to 12, I'll 
find a way to make this interactive later).  Conflict ID found in data/mid/MIDB

Then four graphs will be printed:
1. the trade data for all countries trading with the instigators of side A
2. all the combatants for side A
3/4. the same, except for side B

I'll add more detailed parsing in the future, including:
- ways to combine both graphs and show it as one large model
- making the graph look *much* nicer 
- finding ways to make the combatant graph have the exact same structure as the
  trade graph, just with some nodes removed
- making this easier to use
- whatever else is marked TODO
